<h1>Unreal Engine Vertex Bounding Box Gaussian Trainer</h1>

<h1>Uses Binary based neural network by Moon</h1>

<h3>No human skill- Just Claude Opus regurgitation</h3>

Using Moon's tiny network trained on '8-hot' binary encoded embeddings as a starting point for Claude code conversation, using a code prompt with compressed ideas allows for Claude to better create a base project.

Due to it's simplicity, I used it for CLaude COnversation to prompt a basic project structure, then I cross reference between conversations in a dual instance format to debug issues
