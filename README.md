<h1>Binary based neural network</h1>

<h3>Experimenting with binary embeddings</h3>

This is a tiny network trained on '8-hot' binary encoded embeddings.  

It's trained on a number and itself plus one. The model should return whatever number you give it plus one.  

Overall it seems to work quite well and confidently. It makes some interesting mistakes, things like at points where binary flips (63, 127) it seems to be a bit confused about where to put the new first bit.  

Enjoy.
